Program Description

For our Unit 1 project we chose to create a role & turn based adventure game inspired by some of our favorite module lessons and our favorite jailbreak movies. We haven't seen many jailbreak games, so we thought this would be a fun way to tell a fun story while also involving the user. 

Our reason for creating this program is to showcase our team's skills and to succesfully collaberate on a project. We hope to use all the elements we have learned thus far including, but not limited to: loops, functions, user input, and randomizers.
